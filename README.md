## Conflict Plan 

1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- If there is a conflict itcan be resolved by taking a common sense approach to having a round table discussion to reach a resolution that is agreed upon by everyone.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Have a conversation as a team, and try to come up with a resolution. 
3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- I think we all understand that we come from different places and have different backgrounds and can respect each other in that. As a team we all support the betterment of one another and will contribute evenly to meet that end.
4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Ask clarifying questions to ensure that it is not a problem where they are just stuck and unsure of asking for help etc.
5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- If an only if there was blatent non-communication and an unwillingness to cooperate we could then take the matter to the instructor team for a resolution.

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?
- Slack messages can be sent at anytime. After 6p.m. PST if we are available we can respond. We agree no hard feelings if there is not an immediate reponse after 6p.m.
- Normal class time for tasks, work, and immediate availability in REMO should be 9a.m. PST - 6pm.m. PST.
2. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack and Remo
3. How often will you take breaks?
- We are all adults and feel that breaks can be tentative and so long as they are announced to the group before someone is leaving it should not be an issue.
- Maybe a one time 30 - 1 hr break agreed upon daily around mid-day.
4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- Ask for more TA help to get through situations where we are stuck. Getting more eyes on the situation sooner may speed things along.
- If a situtation is not resolve in say 15mins.
- If we reach a detrimental situation and we need to implement crunch time- we all agree that we may need to stay on later into the late evening.
- If someone does extra work into the late hours or is in the zone and able to get things done- agree to not push up until work is reveiwed and shown to the group the following day.
5. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Slack with no issues.
6. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- Listen;
We all have a mutual respect and understand of one another and the floor is open for anyone and everyone to voice their opinions.
7. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- Collaborative reassurance to provide a safe place to be able to communicate.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
During the start of the day we can go over the daily tasks that we want to try to get done that day.
Use Github to implement daily ToDo's and assign them accordigly. If a person starts to fall behind for that days task we can ensure that the proper questions are asked so that we can either open tickets to get it resolved or move someone over from a task they may be ahead on to tackle what is lagging.
- What project management tool will be used?
Github, Trello, Whiteboarding - InVision, and Miro.

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?
- The entire Project, other than external database. 
2. How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- An organization where we will have our repository for all work where we are all collaborators who are able to pull, push, merge etc.
3. What is your Git flow?
- Having a PR review, with another team member, and then approve the request. 
4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
- Yes
5. How many people must review a PR?
- 2 team members.
6. Who merges PRs?
- The team member that approves the PR will merge. 
7. How often will you merge?
- After all major functional components are finished a PR request and review should be discussed to merge to main.
8. How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
- At our table in REMO. Never merge outside of REMO where most parties can be present.
